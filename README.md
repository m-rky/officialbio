# OfficialBio

[OfficialBio](https://officialb.io) is a link sharing app where you can also post updates and link any relevant social media accounts. 

## What is "link sharing"?

Sometimes we want to share links to our social media or relevant content without having to individually update all of our pages. OfficialBio is a great central place to do that. You'll be able to create your account and share general links, whether that's a funny youtube video or links to your social media pages. Then all you have to do is link to your OfficialBio whenever you want.

## For Users

There is nothing to install, just visit [OfficialBio](https://officialb.io) and create your account to get started.
